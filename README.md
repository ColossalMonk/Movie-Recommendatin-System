# Movie-Recommendatin-System
This repository containts a movie recommendation system that is build in python and concepts of machine learning using the algorithm of content based filter.<br>
I have used Content-Based Filtering i.e filter the recommended movies on the bases on different tags such as Director Name, Actort/Crew, Genre, Title of Movie and many other factors.

*Updates to be made in future*
1. Make the file well commented and readable
2. Add another file using Colaborative Filter method/algorithm.

*Data-Base* <br>


The Database has been saved in a CSV file and is picked up from IMBD and a dataset is filter and cleared already for use.
